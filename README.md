# Magic Square Verifier in MIPS Assembly

This repository contains a MIPS assembly program designed to verify if a given square matrix is a magic square. A magic square is a unique arrangement of numbers in an \(n \times n\) grid where the sums of the numbers in each row, column, and both main diagonals are identical. This project showcases the application of assembly language in solving algorithmic problems, making it an excellent resource for students and enthusiasts interested in computer architecture and low-level programming.

## Features

- Verification of magic squares of any \(n \times n\) size.
- Detailed assembly level implementation of algorithmic logic.
- An example of efficient data handling and computation in MIPS assembly.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you will need a MIPS simulator like MARS or SPIM. Follow these steps:

1. Download and install a MIPS simulator if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open `magicSquare.asm` in your MIPS simulator.
4. Load the matrix data according to the simulator's input method.
5. Run the program to verify if your square matrix is a magic square.
